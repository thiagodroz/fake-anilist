# Apollo Library

[<< README.md](../../README.md)

## About

The `Apollo` library is a lib to be used by other applications with the goal of connecting the application with GraphQL APIs.

## Typings

Inside the `src` folder there is a file called `types.ts` that is generated by the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) based on the Schema of the [Anilist GraphQL API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/) using the following command:

```
yarn graphql-gen
```

This files content **SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED MANUALLY**, but only with the use of `yarn graphql-gen`.
